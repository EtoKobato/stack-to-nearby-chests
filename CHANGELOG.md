- Fixed a possible issue where favorited items do not stay favorited after leaving and reentering a world

- Added "Always show markers for favorited items" toggle. When disabled, markers for favorited items will be hidden until you press the key you assigned in Keymap settings. (Default: Left Alt)

**This version is not compatible with optifabric**
