- The process of iterating through nearby containers is no longer performed in a separate thread to avoid potential thread-safety issues.


- Now you can quick stack all items of one type to nearby containers via shortcut keys or by dragging and dropping items to the "Quick stack to nearby containers" button.


- Changed all "stack to nearby containers" to "quick stack to nearby containers".


- No longer attempts to open blocked shulker boxes.


- Fixed creating BlockHitResult objects with the wrong side.


- Fixed an issue where, occasionally, sneaking would not cancel after quick stacking to nearby container entities.
